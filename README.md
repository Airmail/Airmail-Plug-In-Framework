Airmail Plugin Framework (AMPF) 1.0
============================
The AMPF provides the API necessary to develop a plugin for Airmail.

Why a Plug-In Framework?
============================
The implementation of a plugin is necessary to inherit from the AMPF/AMPlugin class and to override the request methods (see Class Documentation)

The framework is an extended part of Airmail.

Sample plugin
============================
The framework is an extended part of Airmail.

How to install
============================
You need to add a reference to the AMPF in your plugin project in order to use the requested classes. After you build your plugin, copy the bundle in the appropriate directory.
